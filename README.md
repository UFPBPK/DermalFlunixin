# DermalFlunixin

This repository contains the average and population PBPK model code files used in our flunixin dermal PBPK study.

The manuscript title of this study is "Development of a Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Model for Flunixin in Cattle and Swine Following Dermal Exposure". This manuscript is under review.

The “DermalFlunixin” folder contains two subfolders: “calibration and evaluation” and “population PBPK”.

The folder named "calibration and evaluation" contains general PBPK model codes named "cattle mrg pbpk general" for cattle and “swine mrg pbpk general” for swine, as well as the fit function for calibration and evaluation named "modfit_FLU_Cattle" and “modfit_FLU_Swine”. The Excel files are raw data of the experimental PK studies used in the model calibration and evaluation.

The folder named "population PBPK" contains the population PBPK model for cattle and swine. The R code titled "EU cattle pop" is for transdermal flunixin WDI prediction following European Union's defined MRLs for flunixin in cattle."
